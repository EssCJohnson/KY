	<p>The Western Coal Field is the region of Pennsylvanian outcrop in western Kentucky, an area of about 4,680 square miles. It is a
	topographic as well as a structural basin. It is characterized by Pennsylvanian age sandstones, shales and coal. Hopkins, 
	Muhlenberg, and Ohio counties counties still contain a very large amount of coal and have active mining, surface and underground, 
	operations taking place.Kentucky is the fifth-largest coal-producing state in the nation. About one-fifth of all operating
U.S. coal mines are located in Kentucky, more than any other state except West Virginia and
Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p>John James Audubon State Park, named after the famous artist and naturalist, is in this region. John James Audubon was an 
	American self-trained artist, naturalist, and ornithologist. His combined interests in art and ornithology turned into a plan 
	to make a complete pictorial record of all the bird species of North America. Audubon spent more than a decade as a businessman, 
	living and working in Louisville, Kentucky for a time, eventually traveling down the Ohio River to western Kentucky—then the 
	frontier—and setting up a dry-goods store in Henderson.</p>
