	<p>The Eastern Kentucky Coalfield is part of the Central Appalachian bituminous coalfield, including all or parts of 30 Kentucky 
	counties and adjoining areas in Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee. It covers an area from the Allegheny Mountains in 
	the east across the Cumberland Plateau to the Pottsville Escarpment in the west. The region is known for its coal mining; most 
	family farms in the region have disappeared since the introduction of surface mining in the 1940s and 1950s.The region's economy 
	is centered around the natural resources available, which includes coal, timber, natural gas, and oil. Recently, tourism has 
	become a leading industry in the region, due to the region's cultural history and the creation of state parks.</p>
	<p>The Daniel Boone National Forest is located on rough but beautiful terrain along and east of the Pottsville Escarpment. There 
	are many natural arches and sandstone cliffs that are excellent for rock climbing and rappeling. The Red River Gorge, part of the 
	National Forest, is known worldwide in rock climbing circles.Eastern Kentucky has a rich musical heritage. Many nationally 
	acclaimed country music singers and musicians are from the area. These include: Loretta Lynn, Crystal Gayle, The Judds, Ricky Skaggs, 
	Keith Whitley, Patty Loveless, Dwight Yoakam, Tom T. Hall, Billy Ray Cyrus, Jean Ritchie, Sturgill Simpson, Tyler Childers, 
	Chris Stapleton, and George S. Davis.</p>
