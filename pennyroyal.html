	<p>The Pennyroyal Plateau or Pennyroyal Region, often spelled Pennyrile, 
	is a large physiographic region of Kentucky that features rolling hills, 
	caves, and karst topography in general. It is named for a wild mint that 
	grows in the area. It is also called the "Mississippian Plateau," for 
	the Mississippian geologic age in which it was formed. These limestones 
	are soluble (i.e. will dissolve) under the right conditions, which means 
	they can easily be eroded by waters moving through the ground. These 
	groundwaters can form miles of passages beneath the surface, from tiny 
	paths only inches wide, to large caverns and rooms more than 100 feet 
	wide.</p>
	<p>The Pennyroyal is bordered by the Pottsville Escarpment in the east,  
	Muldraugh Hill on the north, and the Jackson Purchase on the west. To the 
	south,the Pennyroyal continues as the Highland Rim of Middle Tennessee.
	The Mammoth Cave-Flint Ridge cave system is the longest cave in the
	world (by far), and is formed in Mississippian-age limestones in the 
	Mississippian Plateau Region	
	Numerous other caves exist in the Pennyroyal, where some of the most 
	intensely cave-forming limestones of the world are to be found. Where the 
	capping sandstone is intact, the land surface is usually forested, rugged hills.</p>
