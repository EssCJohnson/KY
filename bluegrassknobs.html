	<p>The Bluegrass region is a geographic region in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It makes up the central and northern part of the state, roughly bounded by the cities of Frankfort, Paris, Richmond and Stanford.The Bluegrass Region is perhaps Kentucky's most famous region, if not its most visited.The Bluegrass Region is bounded by the Knobs on the west, south, and east, and by the Ohio River in the north. Particularly near the Kentucky River, the region exhibits Karst topography, with sinkholes, caves, and disappearing streams that drain underground to the river. </p>
	<p>Americans settled in number in the region, during the decades which followed the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783). They migrated mostly from Virginia. By 1800 these planters noticed that horses grazed in the Bluegrass region were more hardy than those from other regions; this is due to the soil's high calcium content.[3] Within decades of increased settlement, the remaining herds of bison had moved west. The breeding of Thoroughbred horses was developed in the region, as well as of other quality livestock. Kentucky livestock was driven to Tennessee and other areas of the Ohio River valley for sale.ince the late 20th century, the area has become increasingly developed with residential and commercial properties, particularly around Lexington, the business center. Farms are losing ground to development and slowly disappearing. In 2006, The World Monuments Fund included the Bluegrass region on its global list of 100 most endangered sites.</p>
	<h3>Knobs Region</h3>

	<p>In the horseshoe-shaped Knobs region, where erosion has created hundreds of knob-shaped hills called monadnocks. 
	Part of Daniel Boone National Forest is here. In the middle of the Knobs is the Bluegrass region, named for the 
	bluish-green grass that grows there. Its hills, sinkholes, caves, and springs were all created when the local 
	limestone weathered, or broke down. The region consists of hundreds of isolated, steep sloping, often cone-shaped hills lying at the outer edge of the Bluegrass Region. The Knobs areassociated with the outcrop belt of Silurian and Devonian black and clay shales. Streams that flow through the Knobs and Shale Belt, such as the Rolling
	Fork River and Red River in the east, carve wide valleys with fertile alluvium deposits</p>
