	<p>The Jackson Purchase is the smallest region in Kentucky, consisting of only eight counties: Ballard, Calloway, Carlisle, Fulton, Graves, Hickman, Marshall, and McCracken. The Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers lie between the Purchase and the older parts of Kentucky.Before 1818, the Native American tribe of the Chickasaw owned much of the land on the east bank of the Mississippi River, including 13,000 square miles they considered hunting grounds between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. In that year, the United States bought that tract of virgin wilderness, and annexed it to Kentucky and Tennessee. This bargain with the Chickasaw established the maps of Kentucky and Tennessee as they appear on current maps. While part of the Chickasaw territory, the hunting ground was called ”the land between the rivers”. Afterwards, it became the “Jackson Purchase”, named for General Andrew Jackson, chief negotiator of the purchase.</p> 
	<p>One of the most notable people in the Jackson Purchase region was Alben W. Barkley, a Vice President of the United States from 1949 to 1953, United States Senate Majority Leader who represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate from 1927 to 1949 and 1955 to 1956, and represented the First District in the United States House of Representatives from 1913 to 1927. In 1958, a group of unprofessional historians gathered and created the Jackson Purchase Historical Society. The founders aimed at the intent of preserving the history, study and interest of this unique area.The best known educational building is Murray State University. Though the economy relies on agriculture still today, tourism brings in some people, mostly water related activities.</p>
